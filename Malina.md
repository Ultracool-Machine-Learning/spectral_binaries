# Malina's README

This is Malina's outline of her Random Forest Trial methodology.

## Data

I used the "/spectral_templates_data_version_jul26.h5" from the google drive. 
This is Christian's file, which contains: spectral type, spex type, optical type, name, wavegrid, observation date, system interpolated flux, system interpolated noise, and difference spectrum.



## Normalization


## SNR


## Random Forest Method and Parameters
